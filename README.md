Landing Page Project for The Odin Project


This is the final Project in the Foundations course to incorporate HTML and CSS before moving onto Javascript. Thus, I will be demonstrating all that I've learned thus far. I do want to customize the page, but I will first build the skeleton layout provided by The Odin Project. After that, I will fill in details of my own choosing (as to do so the other way around, I know I will get hung up on the little details.)
